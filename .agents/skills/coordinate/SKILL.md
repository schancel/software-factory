name: coordinate
description: Coordinate sibling workstreams with solution contracts, exclusive work claims, isolated worktrees, and task packets. Use when running parallel workers, locking file or semantic scope, writing an implementation contract, or integrating sibling changes. Does not pick the next backlog item or land. Use when the user runs /coordinate.

# Coordination

Deliver the smallest coherent change that satisfies the accepted outcome while keeping independently evolving subsystems understandable in bounded context. This workflow is model-neutral: use the runtime's available delegation and workspace-isolation facilities without depending on vendor-specific agent names.

Load the tracker from [`.agents/binding`](../../references/load-binding.md) before any tracker verb. Skip ordinary research and lightweight prose edits. A single backlog item with no siblings goes to `$implement`; load this when two or more workstreams, or an integration owner distinct from the workers, are in play. `$backlog-loop` owns the replenishing pool across tickets. This skill owns siblings of one parent outcome.

## Establish the work boundary

Read `AGENTS.md` and only the design or subsystem material relevant to the requested outcome. Before production code, record a compact [solution contract](../../references/solution-contract.md). A direct, well-specified request may serve as most of that contract; do not invent tracker ceremony.

Do not begin implementation until the outcome, non-goals, affected authority, acceptance evidence, repository, exact base revision, and dependencies are sufficiently explicit. When the durable record changes, the contract includes the [cost-of-reversal](../../references/engineering-judgment.md) answers. New product decisions go through the responsible human; a worker or test result cannot manufacture authority.

Record ownership with the [work-claim protocol](../../references/work-claims.md) mapped by the loaded binding.

## Decompose for bounded context

Use [parallel coordination](../../references/parallel-coordination.md) when two or more independently testable workstreams can proceed without concurrent ownership of the same files or semantic boundary. Keep work local when decomposition would add more interface negotiation than useful isolation.

The coordinator owns decomposition, shared interface decisions, dependency order, collision checks, integration, and completion evidence. Each delegated worker receives a [task packet](../../references/task-packet.md) with exclusive scope and returns a narrow handoff. Workers must not silently expand across another worker's subsystem or integrate sibling work themselves unless their packet grants that role.

Prefer cohesive subsystems with narrow facades, private internals, explicit dependency direction, co-located tests, and boundary-level integration proof. Do not create generic abstractions merely to manufacture parallel tasks.

## Integrate siblings, then hand off to review

Workers implement via `$implement`. This skill does not write the feature and does not land.

The integration owner verifies interface compatibility, combines handoffs in dependency order into a clean workspace without merge commits, resolves conflicts with the relevant subsystem owner, and runs affected unit and boundary tests on the combined revision. Worker commits are transport artifacts: squash each accepted feature or fix into its own commit and apply those commits linearly. The combined tip is the candidate. `$review` is the only skill that lands it. Parallel workers finishing their local scopes is not completion by itself.
